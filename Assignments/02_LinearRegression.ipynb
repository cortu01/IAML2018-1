    "## Important Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important that you follow the instructions below to the letter - we will not be responsible for incorrect marking due to non-standard practices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You *MUST* have your environment set up as in the [README](https://github.com/michael-camilleri/IAML2018) and you *must activate this environment before running this notebook*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "source activate py3iaml\n",
    "cd [DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "# Navigate to this file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the instructions carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the code/markdown cell where to put it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some questions which are **specific to those taking the Level-11 version** of the course (INFR11182 and INFR11152). These are clearly marked with the words **(LEVEL 11)** and must be completed by those taking the Level 11 course. Those on the Level 10 version (INFR10069) may (and are advised to) attempt such questions but this will not affect their mark in any way, nor will they get feedback on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The .csv files that you will be using are located at `./datasets` (i.e. use the `datasets` directory **adjacent** to this file).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered with 2-3 lines of explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to show **all** your code/working. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. **Do** use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer. Marks *WILL* be deducted if the marker cannot understand your logic/results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaboration:** You may discuss the assignment with your colleagues, provided that the writing that you submit is entirely your own. That is, you should NOT borrow actual text or code from other students. We ask that you provide a list of the people who you've had discussions with (if any).\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBMISSION Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** You must submit this assignment by **Thursday 18/10/2018 at 16:00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions:** The policy stated in the School of Informatics is that normally you will not be allowed to submit coursework late. See the [ITO webpage](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests) for exceptions to this, e.g. in case of serious medical illness or serious personal problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resubmission:** If you submit your file again, the previous submission is **overwritten**. We will mark the version that is in the submission folder at the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "All submissions happen electronically. To submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fill out this notebook, and save it, making sure to **KEEP the name of the file UNCHANGED**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On a DICE environment, open the terminal, navigate to the location of this notebook, and submit this notebook file using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```submit iaml cw1 \"02_LinearRegression.ipynb\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "  What actually happens in the background is that your file is placed in a folder available to markers. If you submit a file with the same name into the same location, **it will *overwrite* your previous submission**. You can check the status of your submissions with the `show_submissions` command.\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **Distance Learners:** To copy your work onto DICE (so that you can use the `submit` command) you can use `scp` or `rsync` (you may need to install these yourself). You can copy files to `student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk`, then ssh into it in order to submit. The following is an example (replace entries in `[square brackets]` with your specific details):\n",
    "```\n",
    "filename=\"02_LinearRegression.ipynb\"\n",
    "local_scp_filepath=[DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]${filename}\n",
    "server_address=student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk\n",
    "scp -r ${local_scp_filepath} [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}:${filename}\n",
    "# rsync -rl ${local_scp_filepath} [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}:${filename}\n",
    "ssh [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}\n",
    "ssh student.login\n",
    "submit iaml cw1 \"02_LinearRegression.ipynb\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B.: This is still Coursework 1 (cw1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marking Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The Level 10 and Level 11 points are marked out of different totals, however these are all normalised to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**70-100%** results/answer correct plus extra achievement at understanding or analysis of results. Clear explanations, evidence of creative or deeper thought will contribute to a higher grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**60-69%** results/answer correct or nearly correct and well explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**50-59%** results/answer in right direction but significant errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**40-49%** some evidence that the student has gained some understanding, but not answered the questions\n",
    "properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0-39%** serious error or slack work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this is not a programming assignment, in questions which involve visualisation of results and/or long cold snippets, some marks may be deducted if the code is not adequately readable."

    "\n",
    "1. The specification of an automobile in terms of various characteristics \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assigned insurance risk rating \n",
    "   * this rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuaries call this process \u201dsymboling\u201d. A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normalized losses in use as compared to other cars\n",
    "  * the third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year (avg_loss/car/year). \n",
